# INEX Development Workflow

## Two-Page System Overview

The INEX portal now uses a **two-page architecture** to separate management and client interfaces:

### 🔒 Management Dashboard (`index.html`)
- **Your private workspace** for managing the project
- Contains all development tools and planning documents
- **NOT shared with clients**
- Use this to update project status and progress

### 🌐 Public Status Page (`status.html`)
- **What clients see** (like Zebediah)
- Clean, professional interface showing project progress
- **Automatically updates** when you make changes in the management dashboard
- Safe to share with clients

## Daily Workflow

### 1. Start Your Day
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Navigate to "📊 Manage Status" section
3. Review current project status

### 2. Update Progress
1. Click "Update Status" button
2. Enter new progress percentage (0-100)
3. Update status description
4. Click "View Public Status" to verify changes

### 3. Add Weekly Updates
1. Click "Add Update" button
2. Enter date (e.g., "Dec 18")
3. Enter update description
4. Set status (e.g., "In Progress", "Complete", "Planned")

### 4. Quick Actions
- **+10% Progress**: Quick progress increment
- **Next Phase**: Advance to next development phase
- **View Public Status**: Open client status page in new tab

## Real-Time Synchronization

### How It Works
- Changes made in management dashboard → saved to localStorage
- Public status page → reads from localStorage
- Updates appear instantly on both pages
- No manual refresh needed

### What Gets Synced
- ✅ Progress percentage
- ✅ Current phase
- ✅ Status descriptions
- ✅ Weekly updates
- ❌ Internal planning documents
- ❌ Development notes
- ❌ Project management tools

## Client Communication

### What Zebediah Sees
- Professional progress tracking
- Clear timeline visualization
- Weekly status updates
- Clean, branded interface

### What Zebediah Doesn't See
- Your internal planning documents
- Development tools and controls
- Project management interface
- Technical implementation details

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do
- Update progress regularly (at least weekly)
- Use clear, client-friendly language in status updates
- Keep the public page professional and clean
- Test changes by opening both pages

### ❌ Don't
- Share the management dashboard with clients
- Put technical jargon in public status updates
- Forget to update progress after milestones
- Leave outdated information on the public page

## Troubleshooting

### Status Not Updating?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage is working
3. Ensure both pages are from the same domain
4. Try refreshing the public status page

### localStorage Issues?
1. Check browser privacy settings
2. Ensure both pages are served from same origin
3. Clear browser cache if needed
4. Test in incognito/private mode

## Security Notes

- **Management dashboard**: Keep private, don't share URLs
- **Public status page**: Safe to share with clients
- **localStorage**: Client-side only, no server exposure
- **Future**: Consider authentication for management dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start using the management dashboard daily
2. **Short-term**: Add more status update types
3. **Medium-term**: Database integration for persistent storage
4. **Long-term**: User authentication and role-based access
