# INEX Systems Portal

## Overview
Professional operations portal for INEX Systems & Designs, currently in Phase 1: Discovery phase.

## Two-Page Architecture

### 1. Management Dashboard (`index.html`)
- **Purpose**: Internal management interface for development team
- **Access**: Private - only for development team use
- **Features**:
  - Project planning and documentation
  - Status management and updates
  - Progress tracking controls
  - Quick actions for project management

### 2. Public Status Page (`status.html`)
- **Purpose**: Public-facing status page for clients
- **Access**: Public - shareable with clients
- **Features**:
  - Live progress tracking
  - Project timeline visualization
  - Weekly updates
  - Client-friendly interface

## How It Works

1. **Management Dashboard** (`index.html`):
   - Use the "Manage Status" section to update project progress
   - Changes are saved to localStorage
   - Real-time updates are sent to the public status page

2. **Public Status Page** (`status.html`):
   - Automatically reads updates from localStorage
   - Updates in real-time when changes are made from management dashboard
   - Clean, professional interface for client viewing

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser for the management dashboard
2. Navigate to "Manage Status" to update project progress
3. Open `status.html` in another tab to see the public status page
4. Changes made in the management dashboard will automatically appear on the public page

## Status Management

### Updating Progress
- Use the "Update Status" button to change progress percentage
- Use "+10% Progress" for quick increments
- Use "Next Phase" to advance to the next development phase
- Use "Add Update" to add new weekly updates

### Real-time Updates
- All changes are automatically synchronized between pages
- No need to refresh - updates appear instantly
- localStorage ensures data persistence across sessions

## Development Notes
